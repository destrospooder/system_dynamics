It’s a more apt name for what the course actually covers; if you look up Systems Engineering you’ll find a completely different subject.\nThe course text is Ogata’s System Dynamics, which doesn’t fit particularly well for the course. Most feedback control textbooks, like Nise, start with a few chapters covering dynamic modeling and response, but they tend not to be very in depth. I can provide PDFs if you can’t find them yourselves. Read the syllabus, it’s pretty in depth.\nProf. Luchtenburg should put his notes up in the MS Teams Class Notebook and record his lectures. Your mileage may vary if you don’t bother coming to class, though; the audio quality in the recordings isn’t that great and the notes can be less detailed than the lectures themselves.\nMost figures here are taken from Prof. Luchtenburg’s Class Notebook. When I take figures from another source, I will mention it inline. This document is a living document, which means I’ll continue editing it as I see fit. I reserve the right to include material that may not be covered in the course, but better prepares you for concepts that may seem like they come out-of-the-blue otherwise.\nI have this lousy habit of writing in the fourth person and cursing in my writing.

    "text": "1.2 Why Model?\nTo start off, let’s define a model. A mathematical model of a system is a set of differential equations that allows us to predict how a system behaves under different conditions. By creating a model, we can use equations and principles to describe a system’s present behavior, identify key parameters that affect the system, and make educated guesses as to how the system will behave in the future.\nYou may have covered some rudimentary modeling in Ma111 or Ma240, where it was probably crammed in to satisfy those annoying kids that go “wHEN ARe we ever gOINg to usE tHIS iN ReAl LIfE”. The methods we’ll cover in this course will be more robust than simply going off a given formula.\nSomething we’ll exploit heavily a lot in this course is the principle of analogical models, or generic representations of common physical phenomena. This turns out to be really useful because it provides a convenient and consistent way to represent and analyze complex systems that involve different types of “stuff”. Say you’re faced with a fluid flow system, and you haven’t taken a fluid mechanics course yet. Using methods introduced in this course, we will be able to convert this system into something equivalent, yet more familiar, like a mass-spring system or a series circuit. Using these analogies allows us to apply the same concepts and mathematical tools to different types of systems, which can greatly simplify the analysis and design process.\nTo conclude, modeling is a powerful tool that allows us to understand, predict, and (as we’ll see in ME351 next semester) control the behavior of physical systems, and it has many practical applications in engineering, physics, and other fields.\nDon’t suck at it."

    "text": "2.1 Gradients Make Stuff Flow\nA cylindrical tank is filled to a level \\(h\\), has a cross-sectional area of \\(A\\), and an outflow rate of \\(Q_\\text{out}\\). The pressure outside the tank is \\(P_{\\infty}\\). Can we derive a governing equation for this system? Well, we can try with a few physical principles.\nLet’s start with a conservation law. We know there’s a volume \\(V\\) of water proportional to the value of \\(h\\). Or…\n\\[\\Delta V = A \\Delta h\\]\nWe’ll take the time derivative of that equation to get some more familiar variables. (You might recognize the math here from related rates in Ma111.)\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(\\Delta V = A \\Delta h \\right) = -Q_\\text{out}\\]\nThat’s not very useful yet. Let’s leverage some prior circuits knowledge here…charge moves because of a voltage difference \\(\\Delta V\\), and comparably, fluid moves because of a pressure difference. Ohm’s law! We’ll come back to that, but the main takeaway here is that the outflow \\(Q_\\text{out}\\) is related to the difference between the pressure inside the tank \\(P\\) and the atmospheric pressure \\(P_\\infty\\).\nThat circuits analogy comes in handy really often, because it turns out Ohm’s law translates directly into fluid flow.\n\\[\\Delta V = V - V_0 = IR\\] \\[\\Delta P = P-P_\\infty = Q_\\text{out} R\\]\nThese are called constitutive equations, or relationships between physical quantities. (The flow is proportional to a level difference, or gradient.)\nWe’ll generalize a bit soon, but for now I understand if you don’t get it. It’s still very hand-wavey.\nLet’s leverage some hydrostatics now. The tank is open to the atmosphere at the top, so we can actually derive an expression for \\(P\\), the pressure at the base of the tank. We’ll also define \\(\\rho\\), the density of the fluid, and \\(C\\), or capacitance, as \\(\\frac{A}{\\rho g}\\), because it ends up being useful in the circuit analogy.1\n\\[\\Delta P = \\rho g \\Delta h = \\rho g \\frac{\\Delta V}{A} = \\frac{1}{C} \\Delta V\\] \\[C = \\frac{A}{\\rho g}\\]\nOK, I think we’re all set. I’ve been pretty lax with the “delta’s”, but it should still be readable. Let me know if things need clarification.\n\\[\\dot{V} = -Q_\\text{out}\\] \\[C \\dot{P} = - \\frac{\\Delta P}{R}\\] \\[\\boxed{RC \\dot{P} + {\\Delta P} = 0}\\]\nThis is a really nice differential equation. It looks like the equation for an RC circuit if you’ve seen those before, with the voltage differentials swapped out for pressure differentials.\nLet’s move onto a second example: the cooling of a lightbulb. When we shut off power to the lightbulb, how can we measure its temperature as it cools to room temperature?\nThe bulb is initially very hot (with temperature \\(T\\)) compared to its environment (which has temperature \\(T_\\infty\\)). Heat is flowing outwards at \\(\\dot{q}_\\text{out}\\). 2 This is seeming very familiar…a temperature difference is driving heat to leave through the resistance \\(R\\) of the bulb.\nLet’s go through the steps again. What’s being conserved here?3 Internal energy! (Or heat, since there’s no work in this system.) It might be a bit early in the semester to have seen the capacitive relationship relating heat \\(q\\) and temperature \\(T\\) in ESC330, but here it is:\n\\[\\Delta q = C \\Delta T\\]\nDifferentiate across the board…\n\\[\\frac{d}{dt} \\left(C \\Delta T \\right) = C\\dot{T} = -\\dot{q}_\\text{out}\\]\nAnd now we’re just chugging through the motions. Next is another constitutive relationship (which looks shudderingly close to Ohm’s law!):\n\\[\\Delta T = T - T_\\infty = \\dot{q}_\\text{out} R\\]\nUsing this and the conservation equation, we construct:\n\\[\\boxed{RC \\dot{T} + \\Delta T = 0}\\]\nAgain. Familiar. Very familiar. Maybe there’s some unifying theory in the background here. We’ll generalize that equation to what we call its canonical form \\(\\tau \\dot{y} + y = 0\\), a first order differential equation. Let’s throw in an initial condition \\(y(0)=y_0\\) just so we don’t have any undetermined constants at the end.\nTo solve this differential equation, we’ll guess a solution \\(y(t) = ce^{\\alpha t}\\), find its time derivative \\(\\dot{y}(t) = \\alpha ce^{\\alpha t} = \\alpha y\\), and plug in.\n\\[\\tau \\dot{y} + y = 0\\] \\[\\tau \\alpha e^{\\alpha t} + e^{\\alpha t} = 0\\] \\[(\\tau \\alpha + 1) \\; e^{\\alpha t} = 0\\] \\[\\alpha = -\\frac{1}{\\tau}\\] \\[y(t) = ce^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}} = y_0 \\; e^{-\\frac{t}{\\tau}}\\]\nIf you look at the graph below, it’s just exponential decay from \\((0, y_0)\\). We call \\(\\tau\\) the time constant of the system, and it’s commonly used to describe how quickly an exponential decays or grows. Different systems have different time constants. (Notably, \\(RC\\) always has units of time). The smaller the time constant, the faster the decay. (Assume for the figure below that \\(\\tau_1 = 10\\) and \\(\\tau_2 = 5\\).)\nSo what happens when we set \\(t=\\tau\\)? Let’s plug it in and find out.\n\\[y(\\tau) = y_0 e^{-\\frac{\\tau}{\\tau}} = y_0 e^{-1}\\]\nSo the time constant is the time at which the system response has decayed to \\(y_0 e^{-1}\\), or approximately 37% of its initial value. We can also reframe this definition as, “the time constant is the time at which the system response has lost approximately 63% of its initial value”."

Stuff can be stored, like charge in a capacitor, or fluid in a tank, or heat in a reservoir. However, by generalizing these quantities, we can create widely applicable rules for modeling first order systems.\n\\[\\text{Stuff} = \\text{Capacitance} \\times \\text{Level Difference}\\] \\[\\text{Level Difference} = \\text{Flow of Stuff} \\times \\text{Resistance}\\]\nAlso conservation. That’s a biggie. \\[\\text{Rate of Change of Stuff} = \\text{Inflow} - \\text{Outflow}\\]\nWe’ve only discussed scenarios where there isn’t anything flowing in thus far. In these cases, to solve nonhomogeneous differential equations, we’ll have to use more specialized methods from Ma240 instead of guessing and praying, like the Laplace transform or the method of undetermined coefficients (or as I affectionately call it, MUC)."

You may recall from Algebra that the discriminant of a polynomial can reveal some properties of the roots without actually computing them. The discriminant of a quadratic is defined as follows: \\[\\text{Disc}(ax^2 + bx + c) = b^2-4ac\\]\nThis is the argument of the square root in the quadratic formula. If this expression is positive, the solutions to the quadratic are real and distinct. If this expression is 0, then there is only one real solution to the quadratic.

    "text": "3.6 The Tank, Revisited (Inertia)\nLet’s revisit the tank from our study of first order systems. However, we’ll make one small change: the outflow pipe now has a defined length of \\(L_p\\).\nLet’s model the same way we’ve been doing thus far. First, a conservation law:\n\\[\\dot{V} = -Q\\]\nNext, “Ohm’s law”:\n\\[Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R} = \\frac{P - P_\\text{atm}}{R}\\]\nIf we isolate a piece of the pipe (with length \\(L_p\\)) as shown below, we can demystify this system a bit.\nAssuming the cross-sectional area of the pipe \\(A_p\\) is constant, the pressure force \\(F_p = A_p \\Delta P\\) accelerates the fluid between the two ends of this pipe. Additionally, there is friction \\(F_f = -QRA_p\\) on the liquid caused by the resistance of the pipe. By leveraging Newton’s second law of motion, we now have a relationship between the pressure difference \\(\\Delta P\\) and the velocity of the water \\(v\\).\n\\[m \\frac{dv}{dt} = F_p + F_f = A_p \\Delta P - Q R A_p\\]\nThe mass \\(m\\) of the fluid between the two ends of this pipe is equal to the product of the density of the fluid \\(\\rho\\) and the volume between the two ends \\(V_p\\). (Notably, the volume \\(V_p = A_p L_p\\).)\n\\[\\rho \\, V_p \\, \\frac{dv}{dt} = \\rho A_p L_p \\, \\frac{dv}{dt} = A_p \\Delta P - RQ A_p\\]\nBecause the product of the cross-sectional area \\(A_p\\) and the fluid velocity \\(v\\) is equal to the volumetric flow rate \\(Q\\), we can rewrite this equation as follows:\n\\[\\frac{\\rho L_p}{A_p} \\, \\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\Delta P - RQ\\]\nOk, we can shed some light on what we’re doing now. We define inductance (also referred to as liquid-flow inertance or inertia) as a term that describes the change in potential required for a unit rate of fluid flow. Inductance is the tendency of the fluid to move; it’s created by the inertia of water flowing through the pipe. The mathematical definition of inductance is as follows:\n\\[L = \\frac{\\rho L_p}{A_p}\\]\nNote that this definition of inductance is only valid for flow systems, but analogous concepts occur in other fields (like inductors from circuit analysis)! Fluid components that have an inductance are analogous to these inductors, or mechanical components with inertia.\nLet’s wrap up this example. When we plug in the definition of \\(L\\) into our equation, a simple first order system rears its head.9\n\\[L \\, \\frac{dQ}{dt} + RQ = \\Delta P\\]\nLet’s throw it into canonical form so we can see its time constant.\n\\[\\left(\\frac{L}{R}\\right) \\dot{Q} + Q = \\frac{\\Delta P}{R} \\qquad \\qquad \\tau = \\frac{L}{R}\\]\nTo summarize, we’ve added a new tool to our arsenal: conservation of momentum (or Newton’s second law).\n\\[\\Delta P = L \\dot{Q} + RQ\\] \\[\\dot{V} = -Q\\] \\[C \\Delta P = V\\]\nBy combining these three equations, we can use tools from our studies of mass-spring systems to analyze… well… any second order system.\n\\[L \\Delta \\ddot{P} + R \\Delta \\dot{P} + \\frac{1}{C} \\Delta P = 0 \\qquad \\to \\qquad \\Delta \\ddot{P} + \\left(\\frac{R}{L}\\right) \\Delta \\dot{P} + \\left(\\frac{1}{LC}\\right) \\Delta P = 0\\] \\[m \\ddot{q} + b \\dot{q} + k q = 0 \\qquad \\to \\qquad \\ddot{q} + \\left(\\frac{b}{m}\\right) \\dot{q} + \\left(\\frac{k}{m}\\right) q = 0\\]\nWe simply retrofit the definitions of the natural frequency \\(\\omega_n\\) and damping ratio \\(\\zeta\\) based on how we defined them for mass-spring systems to determine how the oscillations behave. Here’s a quick example using the flow system analogy we’ve been using thus far: \\[\\qquad \\ddot{q} + 2\\zeta\\omega_n \\dot{q} + \\omega_n^2 q = 0 \\quad \\longleftrightarrow \\quad  \\Delta \\ddot{P} + \\left(\\frac{R}{L}\\right) \\Delta \\dot{P} + \\left(\\frac{1}{LC}\\right) \\Delta P = 0\\]\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n    2 \\zeta \\omega_n = \\frac{R}{L} \\qquad &\\longrightarrow \\qquad \\zeta = \\frac{R}{2L \\omega_n} = \\frac{R\\sqrt{LC}}{2L} = \\frac{R}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{C}{L}}\\\\\n    \\omega_n^2 = \\frac{1}{LC} \\qquad &\\longrightarrow \\qquad \\omega_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{LC}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{LC}}{LC}\n\\end{align*}\\]"
