{"title":"Course Motivation and Overview","markdown":{"headingText":"Course Motivation and Overview","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n## First Ramblings\n\nThe course is called Systems Engineering in the course catalog, but Prof. Luchtenburg calls it System Dynamics instead. It's a more apt name for what the course actually covers; if you look up Systems Engineering you'll find a completely different subject.\n\nThe course text is Ogata's *System Dynamics*, which doesn't fit particularly well for the course. Most feedback control textbooks, like Nise, start with a few chapters covering dynamic modeling and response, but they tend not to be very in depth. I can provide PDFs if you can't find them yourselves. Read the syllabus, it's pretty in depth.\n\nProf. Luchtenburg *should* put his notes up in the MS Teams Class Notebook and record his lectures (if he hasn't given up using Microsoft Teams yet). Your mileage may vary if you don't bother coming to class, though; the audio quality in the recordings isn't that great and the notes can be less detailed than the lectures themselves.\n\nThis document is a living document, which means I'll continue editing it as I see fit. I reserve the right to include material that may not be covered in the course, but better prepares you for concepts that may seem like they come out-of-the-blue otherwise.\n\nI have this lousy habit of writing in the fourth person and cursing in my writing. Apologies in advance.\n\n## Why Model?\n\nTo start off, let's define a **model**. A mathematical model of a system is a set of differential equations that allows us to predict how a system behaves under different conditions. By creating a model, we can use equations and principles to describe a system's present behavior, identify key parameters that affect the system, and make educated guesses as to how the system will behave in the future.\n\nYou may have covered some rudimentary modeling in Ma111 or Ma240, where it was probably crammed in to satisfy those annoying kids that go \"wHEN ARe we ever gOINg to usE tHIS iN ReAl LIfE\". The methods we'll cover in this course will be more robust than simply going off a given formula.\n\nSomething we'll exploit heavily a lot in this course is the principle of **analogical models**, or generic representations of common physical phenomena. This turns out to be really useful because it provides a convenient and consistent way to represent and analyze complex systems that involve different types of \"stuff\". Say you're faced with a fluid flow system, and you haven't taken a fluid mechanics course yet. Using methods introduced in this course, we will be able to convert this system into more familiar, yet equivalent, like a mass-spring system or a series circuit. Using these analogies allows us to apply the same concepts and mathematical tools to different types of systems, which can greatly simplify the analysis and design process.\n\nTo conclude, modeling is a powerful tool that, if mastered, will allow you to understand, predict, and (as we'll see in ME351 next semester) **control** the behavior of physical systems, and it has many practical applications in engineering, physics, and other fields.\n\nDon't suck at it.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"ch1.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
